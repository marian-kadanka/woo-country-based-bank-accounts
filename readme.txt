Select which BACS gateway bank accounts will be available in certain country/countries

== Description ==

WooCommerce extension which allows you to assign BACS (direct bank transfer) bank accounts to different countries. Based on the billing country chosen, only corresponding bank accounts are then printed on the "thank you" page and in the email send to the customer.

This plugin gives you option to choose which bank account will be available in certain country, or countries.

If you need to have certain bank account to be available in all countries, don't set option for it.

There is also an option to disable BACS payment gateway on the checkout page, if customer billing country doesn't match any of the configured countries.
